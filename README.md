# TheGameOfNIM

Assignment:
------------
Write a program to play the game of NIM.

For those of you who donâ€™t know how to play the game NIM, here are the basic rules:
- There are two players. Your program should have one human player (the user) and one
computer player, and the computer should move first.
- Between the two players is a pile of sticks (or other objects). Your program should start with
12 sticks, but make the program flexible enough that the number of sticks could be easily
changed.
- The players take turns (your program should allow the computer player to start all the time).
On each turn, a player may take 1, 2, 3, or 4 sticks from the pile in the middle. Again, you should make your program flexible enough that you could change this rule to allow taking any number of sticks relatively easily.
- The winner of the game is the player that takes the last stick from the pile.
